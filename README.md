# Description
The project, with the support of the Python programming language and its Pandas library, aims to better understand the cancellation of a given service through data analysis.

# Explanation
The file cancelamentos_sample.csv generates a table containing the "cancelou" field, a column that indicates when the value is 1.0 that the customer canceled the service.

Furthermore, to improve the analysis and ensure more accurate measurement of the number of customers who dropped out, filters were applied, such as the contract duration being different from monthly.

# Libraries
### 1) Pandas
Pandas is a widely used Python library for handling, analyzing, and exploring structured data. It provides fast, flexible, and easy-to-use data structures, such as DataFrames and Series, which simplify working with large datasets.

### 2) Plotly
Plotly is a Python library focused on data visualization, allowing the creation of dynamic, customizable, and highly interactive charts, with support for 2D and 3D representations.
