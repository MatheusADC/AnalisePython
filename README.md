The project, with the support of the Python programming language and its Pandas library, aims to better understand the cancellation of a given service through data analysis.

The file cancelamentos_sample.csv generates a table containing the "cancelou" field, a column that indicates when the value is 1.0 that the customer canceled the service.

Furthermore, to improve the analysis and ensure more accurate measurement of the number of customers who dropped out, filters were applied, such as the contract duration being different from monthly.
